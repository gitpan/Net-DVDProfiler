=head1 NAME

Net-DVDProfiler - Get the UPC numbers for your DVD collection, located on DVD Profiler.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module that uses LWP to connect to a remote DVDProfiler collection and acquire all available DVD UPC symbols. Once all the symbols have been acquired, they can then be plugged into another application, such as the module Net::Amazon::DVD2IMDB, to get all the IMDB IDs for the DVDs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Print out the names of all the movies in your DVD Profiler collection.

    use Net::DVDProfiler;

    my $ua = new Net::DVDProfiler( alias => 'YOURALIAS' );

    print map { $_->title() . "\n" } @{$ua->getAll()};
    
=over 4

=item B<new>

    my $ua = new Net::DVDProfiler( alias => 'YOURALIAS' );
    
Instantiates an object with which to perform further requests. Requires a valid user alias to be provided.

=item B<getAll>, B<getOwned>, B<getOrdered>, and B<getWishlist>

    $ua-getAll();
    
Returns an array of Net::DVDProfiler::DVD objects. Each of the objects have a title and upc method, which can be accessed to receive that information.
